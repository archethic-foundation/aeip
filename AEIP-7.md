# Abstract

DApp/Wallet communications should not be bound to AEWallet nor a specific SDK.

This document describes the API any DApp/Archethic communication lib should comply to.

For practical reasons, data structure are described using `typescript` syntax. Nevertheless, this is indented to be language agnostic.

# Appendix I : Typescript interface

[Appendix I](./AEIP-7-1.ts) describes the API interface.
