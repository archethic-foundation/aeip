# Abstract

The following standard defines the specification for deep linking.
Deep linking does this by specifying a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens a mobile app if it's already installed. 
This specification will define the standard and the structure of the links for Archethic ecosystem.

# Specification

These links are simply web-browser-like-links that activate your app and may contain information that you can use to load specific section of the app or continue certain user activity from a website (or another app).

App Links and Universal Links are regular https links, thus if the app is not installed (or setup correctly) they'll load in the browser, allowing you to present a web-page for further action, eg. install the app.
