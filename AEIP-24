# Abstract

This AEIP proposes an enhancement to the Archethic blockchain's transaction validation process. It addresses the scalability issue related to transaction and input validation, particularly in the context of sharding where not all nodes store every transaction. The proposal introduces aggregated cross-validation and storage signatures to reduce the data footprint and optimize network operations.

# Specification

## Problem Statement

In the current Archethic network, validating transactions that are not present in a node's database requires querying other nodes that store them. The absence of a mechanism to verify the authenticity of this retrieved data can lead to the validation of incorrect transactions or inputs.

## Proposed Solution

The solution consists of two aggregated entities:
1. **Aggregated Cross Validation**: Combines 197 signatures from cross-validation nodes into a single entity.
2. **Aggregated Storage Signature**: Consolidates signatures from storage nodes into one.

These aggregates will replace the extensive list of individual signatures, reducing the signature data by a factor of 200 and enabling faster verification.

### Solution Process

1. A transaction is sent to any node (welcome node).
2. The welcome node selects validation nodes and forwards the transaction for pre-validation.
3. Validation nodes retrieve necessary transactions for validation.
4. Cross-validation nodes rebuild the context and communicate with the coordinating node.
5. The coordinator node rebuilds the transaction context, completes the validation, and issues a validation stamp.
6. Cross-validation nodes verify the validation stamp and issue their own stamps.
7. Nodes begin the replication process and notify completion.
8. Aggregated signatures are computed and replace individual transaction signatures.

# Motivation

The current transaction validation method in Archethic is not scalable and requires significant network resources. This proposal aims to streamline the process, ensuring robust security and efficiency.

# Rationale

The proposed solution not only saves storage space but also accelerates the data verification process on the Archethic network, which is crucial for maintaining high throughput and scalability as the network grows.

# Backwards Compatibility

The proposed changes are backwards compatible as they enhance the validation process without altering the underlying transaction structure.
